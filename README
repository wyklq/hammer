    INTRODUCTION
    ------------
    hammer.git provides simple scripts and tools for building a complete Linux
    distribution. The idea is that you pull this stuff into your project and
    the zero-length files are hooks (the supported interface) that you are
    supposed to modify.


    ENVIRONMENT
    -----------
    Some magic enviroment variables:

        WEAK_DEPS
            When set to "1", strict dependency rules between subsystems are
            bypassed and a clean build within a subsystem is not enforced
            when some build script is modified. This is mainly useful when
            developing & build-testing a newly added package to avoid a
            complete rebuild of everything. Using this option may result in
            some stale files remaining whenever the content of some package
            changes, and generally results in a nonreproducible build.

        <package name>_force
            When set, forces a rebuild of a single package. This is mainly
            useful only together with "<package name>_sources" variable.

        <package name>_sources
            Specifies a directory that overrides a package source code from
            the content defined by PKG_URL. This is mainly useful when
            developing new patches against a package (by modifying its source
            tree) or when trying out a new version of a package or while
            bisecting a package etc. Using this option very likely results in a
            nonreproducible build.


    At this time, there is no more documentation available, sorry.
