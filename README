    INTRODUCTION
    ------------
    hammer.git provides simple scripts and tools for building a complete Linux
    distribution. The idea is that you pull this stuff into your project and
    the zero-length files are hooks (the supported interface) that you are
    supposed to modify.

    At this time, there is no more documentation available, sorry.
